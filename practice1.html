        5 Recipes That Are a Sure Thing<br>

        Back in March, during those first terrifying weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, I started writing<br>
        a series of articles as a way to help cooks figure out how to use the mountain of beans and pasta<br>
        many of us had manically laid in, in case we couldn’t, or didn’t feel comfortable, leaving the<br>
        house.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Called From the Pantry, it was intended to provide recipes that were versatile enough to cut<br>
        down on anxiety-ridden trips to the supermarket, while still being satisfying to eat and calming to<br> 
        cook. The recipes, written narratively, were a real-time kitchen diary, based on what I had in my<br>
        own pantry, and created with an eye toward giving readers wiggle room to use what was in<br>
        theirs.
